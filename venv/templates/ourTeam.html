              <p>
                Hey everyone, my name is Anthony Natale and I'm a first semester graduate student taking this class from Charlotte, NC.<br><br>

                I chose to pursue a degree in computer science because I believe strongly in service. Computers, automation, and the internet are helping humans to become and remain more connected than ever. They speed up learning and business efforts in ways that never could have been imagined. Every job in the world is about producing, creating, fixing, or helping. The computer scientist or software engineer has a chance to do every one of these things in each piece of software, and I'm convinced it's the career I want.

              <p>
                Hello Everyone, My name is Huan-Yun Chen go by Oliver. I'm from Raleigh North Carolina, currently a master student for Computer Science at East Carolina University. I studied Bachelor Science of Computer Science for my undergradute degree in East Carolina University.<br><br>
                I picked Computer Science as my major because I had expereince with programming during the high shcool and I absolutely love it, my father is a software engineer
                therefore I had a lot of exposure to programming since I was little. ALso, Job oppurtunities are definly one of the reason why I choise this field.
                I decide to take CSCI 4710 web deisgn because I would love to reinforce and learn more detail of web design and web application developlment. I'm currently working on a NSF project,
                where I self taught myself react and node js. I want to learn in depth detail of restful api and other tips.

              <h3>Jared Mello</h3>
              <p>
                My name is Jared Mello. I graduated with an BS in Computer Science and a BA in English from NCWC in Rocky Mount. I found out that my Computer Science degree was actually closer to Information and Computer Technology.<br><br>

                I chose this course and Computer Science as a Master's to really try and get at the core of the field that has evaded me the past few years, as most of my programming experience has been concentrated in the HTML, PHP, and C++ languages.
